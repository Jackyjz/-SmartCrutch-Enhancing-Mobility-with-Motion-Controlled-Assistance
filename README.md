✨ Inspiration
🚶‍♂️ Mobility challenges affect millions, especially those using crutches. We wanted to create an intuitive solution that enhances movement effortlessly and safely.

⚙️ What it does
🦾 SmartCrutch is a gyroscope-controlled mobility aid attached to guide crutches. It moves based on tilts—lean forward to move, tilt left/right to turn, and lean back to stop. An ultrasonic sensor 🛑 prevents collisions.

🔧 How we built it
🛠️ We used:

MPU6050 gyroscope 🌀 for tilt detection
Arduino Uno 🎛️ as the main controller
Motor driver 🚗 for movement
Ultrasonic sensor 📡 for obstacle avoidance
📌 Fine-tuning sensor data ensured smooth and reliable control.
🚧 Challenges we ran into
⚡ Sensor noise: Filtering gyroscope readings for stability
🎯 Motor control: Calibrating smooth, responsive movement
🔗 Integration: Merging sensor data with motor logic
🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
✅ Successfully implemented motion-based control
✅ Integrated real-time obstacle detection
✅ Built a functional prototype in the hackathon time limit

🎓 What we learned
📊 Optimizing sensor data is crucial for smooth control
🔌 Hands-on experience with Arduino, motor drivers, and gyroscopes
🤝 The importance of user-friendly design in assistive technology

🚀 What's next for SmartCrutch: Torch in the Darkness
🔹 Bluetooth connectivity 📡 for remote assistance
🔹 Voice commands 🎙️ for extra control
🔹 Machine learning 🤖 to adapt to different walking styles
